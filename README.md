As a table tennis player myself, my ulterior motive is to determine which playing style I should adopt when playing against my friends in a non-competitive casual setting. I want to choose the most unique/least common playing style such that my friends will have a much more difficult time and more headaches trying to adapt.

### Conclusion

Based on the data, I should be using a defensive style using a left-hand penhold grip because this is the most unique/least common playing style. 

**However**, the data is not truly representative of the general population and does not account for possible confounding variables such as: dominant hand and culture...

That being said, I will experiment with playing a defensive style and adjust my grip or playing-hand if necessary.
